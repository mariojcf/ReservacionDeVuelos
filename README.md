# Proyectofinal

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.3.8.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
http-server
```

When we run this code, we will need to select the IP address of the website.

Once we're on the main login page, we'll need to create a new user or log in, and that's it! Now we can make reservations! Have a good trip!

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
